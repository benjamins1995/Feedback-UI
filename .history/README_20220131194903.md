# React Feedback App

This project i made in React during studying the course "Front To Back 2022".
It allows users to add, update and delete feedback. It uses a mock REST api with json-server.

[ Link to feedback to see how it works ](https://feedback-app-ui.netlify.app/)

This link is without a server side, just hard coded as opposed to the code above that contains HTTP Requests to JSON server.

#### This project goes over all of the fundamentals of React including...

- Components
- JSX
- Props (proptypes, defaultprops, etc)
- State (Component & App Level)
- Styling
- Handling Events
- Lists & Keys
- Forms
- Context API
- HTTP Requests

# Usage

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run JSON-server on port :5000 and React on port :3000
