# React Feedback App

This project i made in React during studying the course "Front To Back 2022".
It allows users to add, update and delete feedback. It uses a mock REST api with json-server.

[Link to YouTube to see how it works](https://youtu.be/lgDbLF5Fq4U)

#### This project goes over all of the fundamentals of React including...

- Components
- JSX
- Props (proptypes, defaultprops, etc)
- State (Component & App Level)
- Styling
- Handling Events
- Lists & Keys
- Forms
- Context API
- HTTP Requests

# Usage

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run

```

This will run JSON-server on port :5000 and React on port :3000
