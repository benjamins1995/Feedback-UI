# React Feedback UI App

This project i made in React during studying the course "Udemy - Front To Back 2022".
It allows users to add, update and delete feedback. It uses a mock REST api with json-server.

[Link to YouTube to see how it works](https://youtu.be/lgDbLF5Fq4U)

# Usage

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run JSON-server on port :5000 and React on port :3000
